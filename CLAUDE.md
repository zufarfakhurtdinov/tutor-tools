# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is currently an empty repository. When code is added to this repository, this file should be updated to include:

1. **Build and Development Commands**: How to install dependencies, build, test, lint, and run the project
2. **Architecture Overview**: High-level structure and key design patterns used in the codebase
3. **Development Workflow**: Any specific patterns, conventions, or processes used in this project
4. **Configuration**: Important configuration files and their purposes

## Getting Started

Once this repository contains code, future Claude Code instances will need information about:
- Package manager used (npm, yarn, pip, cargo, etc.)
- Main entry points and key directories
- Testing framework and how to run tests
- Build process and deployment requirements
- Any special development setup or environment requirements

This file should be updated as the codebase evolves to maintain useful guidance for automated development assistance.
