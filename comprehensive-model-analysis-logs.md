## Comparative Analysis

### Transcription Accuracy
- **whisper-small**: More accurate word recognition ("Mira" vs "mirror", "1." vs "One.")
- **whisper-base**: Some transcription errors but consistent timing patterns

### Pause Duration Patterns
- **whisper-base**: Larger pause values, more consistent major breaks
- **whisper-small**: Smaller pause values, more granular detection

### Segmentation Quality
- **Neither model** produces acceptable results for 6-segment requirement
- **whisper-base**: Closer to target but misses boundary cases
- **whisper-small**: Over-segments due to detecting too many breaks

### Processing Performance
- **whisper-base**: Faster initialization (~27s total)
- **whisper-small**: Slower initialization, requires extended timeouts (~54s total)

---

## Conclusion

Both models demonstrate fundamental limitations for pause-based segmentation:

1. **Model Dependency**: Pause measurements vary significantly between models
2. **Threshold Sensitivity**: No single threshold works reliably across content
3. **Semantic Blindness**: Algorithm cannot distinguish conversation boundaries from other pauses
4. **Over/Under-Segmentation**: Static thresholds either catch too many or too few segments

**RECOMMENDATION**: Current pause-based approach is **UNACCEPTABLE** for production use with "by pauses" audio file requirements.
