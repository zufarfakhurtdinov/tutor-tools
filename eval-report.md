## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Analysis

### Time Distribution
- **Fastest Processing:** 12s (Unit3_Track_12, Unit6_Track_21)
- **Slowest Processing:** 45s (Unit2_Track_06 - timeout case)
- **Successful Files Average:** 20s (18s + 22s / 2)
- **Failed Files Range:** 12s - 45s
- **Processing vs Wall Clock:** 186s vs 213s (87% efficiency)

### Stage Performance
- **Initialization:** 10/10 (100% success)
- **Upload:** 10/10 (100% success)
- **Transcription:** 10/10 (100% success)
- **Extraction:** 9/10 (90% success)
- **Download:** 9/10 (90% success)

## üéØ Segment Extraction Analysis

### Expected vs Actual Segments
- **Total Expected:** 52 segments (estimated)
- **Total Extracted:** 33 segments
- **Extraction Rate:** 63.5%

### Per-File Segment Analysis
- **Perfect Matches:** 2 files (20%)
- **Close Matches (¬±1):** 1 file (Unit6_Track_21: 5/6)
- **Significant Gaps:** 7 files (multiple segments missing)

## üìù Test Configuration Notes

### Files Marked by Pauses
Two files in the test suite are specifically marked as "by pauses" in the evaluation configuration:
- **Unit11_Page80_Track_41.mp3** (Line 57 in eval-workflow-sequential.js)
- **Unit2_Page12_Track_06.mp3** (Line 59 in eval-workflow-sequential.js)

These files are expected to have segments determined by audio pause detection rather than spoken numbers. Both files failed in this test run:
- Unit11_Track_41: Expected 6 segments, got 2 (major detection failure)
- Unit2_Track_06: Expected 6 segments, got 0 (complete extraction timeout)

The poor performance on pause-detected files suggests the pause detection algorithm may need significant improvements.

## üîç Failure Analysis

### Primary Issues
1. **Segment Count Mismatches (7 files):** Algorithm extracting fewer segments than expected
2. **Extraction Timeouts (1 file):** Unit2_Track_06 fails at extraction stage
3. **Clarification Required (1 file):** Unit5_Track_19 intentionally marked for review

### Error Patterns
- **Console Errors:** 3-5 errors per file, consistent across tests
- **Extraction Stage:** Main bottleneck with 10% failure rate
- **Timeout Threshold:** 30s may be insufficient for complex audio files

## üìà Comparison with Historical Data

### Previous Documented Performance (CLAUDE.md)
- **Historical Success Rate:** 80% (8/10 passed)
- **Current Success Rate:** 20% (2/10 passed)
- **Performance Degradation:** 60 percentage points decline

### Possible Causes
- Algorithm changes or model updates
- Different test environment conditions
- Audio file complexity variations
- System resource constraints

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate Segment Detection Algorithm:** Review why extraction is missing expected segments
2. **Analyze Unit2_Track_06:** Understand timeout root cause
3. **Review Console Errors:** Address recurring error patterns
4. **Increase Timeout Threshold:** Consider extending beyond 30s for complex files

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Algorithm Tuning:** Improve segment boundary detection accuracy
2. **Error Handling:** Better graceful degradation for problematic files
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Implement automated regression detection
4. **Test Suite Enhancement:** Add more granular segment validation
