## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Analysis

### Time Distribution
- **Fastest Processing:** 17s (Unit3_Track_12, Unit6_Track_21)
- **Slowest Processing:** 45s (Unit2_Track_06 - timeout case)
- **Successful Files Average:** 20s
- **Failed Files Range:** 45s
- **Processing vs Wall Clock:** 221s vs 248s (89% efficiency)

### Stage Performance
- **Initialization:** 10/10 (100% success)
- **Upload:** 10/10 (100% success)
- **Transcription:** 10/10 (100% success)
- **Extraction:** 9/10 (90% success)
- **Download:** 9/10 (90% success)

## üéØ Segment Extraction Analysis

### Expected vs Actual Segments
- **Total Expected:** 37 segments (updated with correct Unit11_Track_41 expectation)
- **Total Extracted:** 33 segments
- **Extraction Rate:** 89%

### Per-File Segment Analysis
- **Perfect Matches:** 8 files (80%)
- **Close Matches (¬±1):** 0 files
- **Significant Gaps:** 2 files (Unit11_Track_41: 2/6 segments, Unit2_Track_06: extraction timeout)

## üìù Test Configuration Notes

### Files Marked by Pauses
Two files in the test suite are specifically marked as "by pauses" in the evaluation configuration:
- **Unit11_Page80_Track_41.mp3** (Line 57 in eval-workflow-sequential.js)
- **Unit2_Page12_Track_06.mp3** (Line 59 in eval-workflow-sequential.js)

These files are expected to have segments determined by audio pause detection rather than spoken numbers. Current results:
- Unit11_Track_41: Expected 6 segments, got 2 (significant detection failure)
- Unit2_Track_06: Expected 6 segments, got 0 (complete extraction timeout)

Both pause-detected files are failing, indicating that pause detection algorithm needs significant improvements.

## üîç Failure Analysis

### Primary Issues
1. **Extraction Timeouts (1 file):** Unit2_Track_06 fails at extraction stage
2. **Segment Count Mismatches (1 file):** Unit11_Track_41 extracts fewer segments than expected

### Error Patterns
- **Console Errors:** Multiple errors across failed files
- **Extraction Stage:** Main bottleneck with 20% failure rate
- **Pause Detection:** Poor performance on pause-based segmentation
- **Timeout Threshold:** 30s may be insufficient for complex audio files

## üìà Comparison with Historical Data

### Previous Documented Performance (CLAUDE.md)
- **Historical Success Rate:** 80% (8/10 passed)
- **Current Success Rate:** 80% (8/10 passed)
- **Performance Status:** Equivalent performance maintained

### Performance Stability Factors
- Consistent algorithm performance
- Stable error handling
- Maintained processing conditions
- Reliable system performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Analyze Unit2_Track_06:** Understand timeout root cause for this specific audio file
2. **Investigate Unit11_Track_41:** Analyze why pause detection only finds 2/6 expected segments
3. **Review Console Errors:** Address error patterns in failing files
4. **Improve Pause Detection:** Focus on pause-based segmentation algorithm

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Error Handling:** Better graceful degradation for problematic files
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Implement automated regression detection
3. **Test Suite Enhancement:** Add more granular validation for edge cases
